	 <p> The almond (Prunus dulcis, syn. Prunus amygdalus) is a species of tree native to Iran and surrounding countries but widely cultivated elsewhere. The almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree. Within the genus Prunus, it is classified with the peach in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell (endocarp) surrounding the seed.</p>

   <p> An apricot is a fruit, or the tree that bears the fruit, of several species in the genus Prunus (stone fruits).Usually, an apricot is from the species P. armeniaca, but the fruits of the other species in Prunus sect. Armeniaca are also called apricots</p>

	<li> Raisin </li>

	<p>A raisin is a dried grape. Raisins are produced in many regions of the world and may be eaten raw or used in cooking, baking, and brewing. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia, the word raisin is reserved for the dark-colored dried large grape,[1] with sultana being a golden-colored dried grape, and currant being a dried small Black Corinth seedless[2] grape.</p>
	<br>

	<li> Cashew</li>
	<hr>
	
	<img src="cashew.jpg" width="300px;">
	<p> The cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale) is a tropical evergreen tree that produces the cashew seed and the cashew apple pseudofruit. The tree can grow as high as 14 m (46 ft), but the dwarf cultivars, growing up to 6 m (20 ft), prove more profitable, with earlier maturity and greater yields.</p>
	<br>

	<li> Pistachio </li>
	<hr>

	<img src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VubFAOVk3nTRhz1eIcoRcgAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&w=245&h=150">
	<p> The pistachio a member of the cashew family, is a small tree originating from Central Asia and the Middle East. The tree produces seeds that are widely consumed as food.Pistacia vera often is confused with other species in the genus Pistacia that are also known as pistachio. These other species can be distinguished by their geographic distributions (in the wild) and their seeds which are much smaller and have a soft shell.</p>

	<li> saffron </li>
	<hr>

	<img src="saffron.jpg" width="300px;">
	<p> Saffron is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as the "saffron crocus". The vivid crimson stigma and styles, called threads, are collected and dried for use mainly as a seasoning and colouring agent in food. Saffron has long been the world's costliest spice by weight. Although some doubts remain on its origin, it is believed that saffron originated in Iran. However, Greece and Mesopotamia have also been suggested as the possible region of origin of this plant. Harold McGee states that it was domesticated in or near Greece during the Bronze Age. C. sativus is possibly a triploid form of Crocus cartwrightianus,which is also known as "wild saffron".Saffron crocus slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania.</p>

     2.Nuts
     <hr>
<ol>
	
	<li> Walnut </li>
	<hr>

	<img src="walnut.jpg" width="300px;">
	<p> A walnut is the nut of any tree of the genus Juglans , particularly the Persian or English walnut, Juglans regia.A walnut is the edible seed of a drupe, and thus not a true botanical nut. It is commonly consumed as a nut. After full ripening for its edible seed when the shell has been discarded, it is used as a garnish or a snack. Nuts of the eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) and butternuts (Juglans cinerea) are less commonly consumed.</p>
	<br>

	<li> Pinenut </li>
	<hr>

	<img src="pinenut1.jpg" width="300px;">
	<p> Pine nuts, also called piñón or pignoli, are the edible seeds of pines (family Pinaceae, genus Pinus). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, only 29 species provide edible nuts, while 20 are traded locally or internationally  owing to their seed size are large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines, the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of notable value as a human food.</p>
	<br>

	<li> Cashewnut </li>
   <hr>

	<img src="cashewnut.jpg" width="300px;">
	<p>The cashew seed is commonly considered a snack nut (cashew nut) eaten on its own, used in recipes, or processed into cashew cheese or cashew butter.[3] Like the tree, the nut is often simply called cashew. Cashew allergies are triggered by the proteins found in tree nuts, and cooking often does not remove or change these proteins.</p>
	<br>

	<li> Betelnut </li>
  <hr>

	<img src="betelnut2.jpg" width="300px;">
	<p> Betel nut is the nut that comes from a plant called Areca. It is sometimes used to make medicine. Betel nut is chewed alone or in the form of quids, a mixture of tobacco, powdered or sliced betel nut, and other ingredients.Betel nut is used for schizophrenia, a group of eye disorders that can lead to vision loss (glaucoma), poor digestion, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Using betel nut might also be unsafe.</p>

	<li> Chestnut </li>
   <hr>

	<img src="chestnut.jpg" width= "300px;">
	<p> The chestnuts are a group of eight or nine species of deciduous trees and shrubs in the genus Castanea, in the beech family Fagaceae. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.The name also refers to the edible nuts they produce.</p>
	<br>

	<li> Coconut </li>
	<hr>

	<img src="coconut.jpg" width= "300px;">
	<p> The coconut tree (Cocos nucifera) is a member of the palm tree family (Arecaceae) and the only living species of the genus Cocos. The term "coconut" (or the archaic "cocoanut")can refer to the whole coconut palm, the seed, or the fruit, which botanically is a drupe, not a nut. The name comes from the old Portuguese word coco, meaning "head" or "skull", after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features. They are ubiquitous in coastal tropical regions and are a cultural icon of the tropics.</p>
